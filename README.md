# Simplest-LM386-Audio-Amplifier-in-Proteus
Proteus Projects of Simplest LM386 Audio Amplifier 
This is a really amazing project that is nifty as well. The projects takes the sound as input, then these signals are amplified with the help of lm386 integrated Circuit. The Poutput signals are aplified and these are shown at the oscilloscope. For more interesting projects, just click at the www.theengineeringprojects.com ..
